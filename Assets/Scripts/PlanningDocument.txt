Normal dialogue:
* Speaker's name (can be left blank)
* Dialogue text
* Time visible (must not be less than or equal to 0)
* Speaker's image (if left blank, just don't update the image and use the previous one)
* Choices array (optional)
   - Includes player's text, love increment (or decrement), and a list of your date's responses (which, itself, includes name, text, time, and image. Does NOT include another array)

How to program:

There are sets of dialogue (one per question). Each set of dialogue has multiple lines.

For each set of dialogue...

For each line of dialogue...
* Update the speaker box with the name
* Update the dialogue box with the text
* Update the hidden timer with the new time (don't forget to reset it as well)
* Update the speaker's image (if one was provided)
* If there is NOT a choice array, hide the buttons
   - Once the timer runs out, move to the next dialogue
* Otherwise (there IS a choice array), update-and-show the buttons
   - If a button IS selected before the timer runs out, run through the sub-array of dialogue
   - If a button is NOT selected before the timer runs out, run through the default sub-array of dialogue (last index)
